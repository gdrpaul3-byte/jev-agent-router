# JEV Agent Router

**Choose the next tool with JEV or an LLM, reuse exact results, and keep execution under the host's control.**

**JEV·LLM·캐시로 다음 도구를 선택하고, 실제 실행과 권한 검증은 호스트가 담당하는 로컬 라우터입니다.**

## What this does

A host such as Codex or Claude supplies a task, current evidence, and a finite list of available tools or workers. The router recommends one route. It does not execute the selected worker, send messages, connect a bot, or grant permission to publish.

- **Adaptive routing:** reuse a valid exact result; otherwise select JEV, Luna, or Astra using host-supplied difficulty and scoped cost/cache observations. A semantic abstention can escalate once to Astra within the configured limits.
- **Durable task routing:** shadow comparison, active local handoff files, and an offline handoff reader that checks the committed ledger against the current input.
- **Bounded browser helpers:** adapters for a host's existing Codex browser session and a Claude in Chrome decision/authorization/verification bridge. The actual Claude browser integration has **not been live-validated**.
- **Accounting:** record calls, observed token usage, provider cost estimates or reported credit charges, cache reuse, and uncertain outcomes. Unknown costs remain `null`.

This is a local Node.js runtime with optional host skills, not a replacement for Codex, Claude, or their browser tools. A skill tells the host how to use the runtime; installing it does not install API credits or establish a browser connection.

## Measured whole-workflow comparison

On 2026-09-24, two Korean **synthetic** missions covered scholarship allocation and public-grant selection. Each had a base case and changed evidence. Every arm selected local evidence and used **Astra for final structured synthesis**. All arms received the same exact-cache and prompt-cache opportunities.

| Arm | Core checks, fresh workflows | Strict checks including citations | Mean fresh workflow time | Cost of 4 fresh workflows |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Astra routing + Astra synthesis | 4/4 | 4/4 | 12.996 s | $0.26512300 |
| Luna routing + Astra synthesis | 4/4 | 4/4 | 12.735 s | $0.21389040 |
| Adaptive routing + Astra synthesis | 4/4 | 3/4 | 11.196 s | $0.21446232 |

The adaptive arm selected JEV for every fresh routing call in this run. Its automatic warm-Luna selection and Astra escalation are covered by mock tests, not demonstrated by these live results. The adaptive arm had the lowest observed mean time; Luna + Astra had the lowest observed total cost. These are descriptive results from four fresh workflows per arm, not evidence of general superiority.

There were **12 fresh workflows, 6 exact replays, and 36 actual POST requests**. Each exact replay added zero model requests and zero provider cost. Changed evidence caused new synthesis; unchanged routing subtasks could reuse their own exact result. The total **$0.69347572** combines JEV input list-price estimates with OpenRouter-reported credit charges. It excludes host inference, funding fees, taxes, and downstream tools; it is not a card bill.

The one strict failure was a final-step citation-set mismatch. An independent agent review found that the supplied citations supported that step, but the **frozen score remains 11/12 strict, 12/12 core**. The fixtures are agent-authored development cases, not a human-validated benchmark. See the [full conditions](benchmarks/results/complex-missions-v1/RESULTS.md), [interpretation](benchmarks/results/complex-missions-v1/INTERPRETATION.md), [frozen manifest](benchmarks/results/complex-missions-v1/report.json.manifest.json), and [verification record](benchmarks/results/complex-missions-v1/verification.json).

Current release verification: **734 automated tests passed, zero failures**. The original measured run records 718 tests before inference and 722 after the first router refinements. Run `npm run test:all` to verify your installed revision.

A read-only live progress dashboard and bilingual recording instructions are included. **No screen-recorded live demo has been published yet.** The measured results above come from the preserved API report.

## Quick start

Requirements: **Node.js 24+**, npm, and a local writable directory. Run these commands from the repository root. No browser or API key is needed for offline checks.

```sh
npm ci
npm run test:all
node -- src/adaptive-router-cli.mjs --preflight --input examples/adaptive-router-task.json --config examples/adaptive-router-config.json
node --use-system-ca -- benchmarks/complex-mission-eval.mjs --preflight
```

For live use, create a private `.env` from `.env.example` and enter your own `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` and `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in a local editor. They are separate provider credentials; a host subscription or `OPENAI_API_KEY` does not substitute for them. Keep keys out of prompts, command arguments, screenshots, and Git. [Detailed setup and troubleshooting →](docs/INSTALL.en.md)

```sh
# Paid decision; the example limits one decision to at most 2 POSTs.
node --use-system-ca -- src/adaptive-router-cli.mjs --live --input examples/adaptive-router-task.json --config examples/adaptive-router-config.json --state-dir .jev-router-adaptive --env-file .env

# Optional: teach both hosts to use this checkout's adaptive router.
node -- scripts/install-skill.mjs --agent both --skill adaptive
```

`selected` means a recommendation is available. The host still checks `requiresHostApproval`, current evidence, tool availability, and user authorization before using its own execution tools. `needs_host` means stop and inspect the reason; do not hide it with a retry loop.

## Cache and cost boundaries

- **Exact result cache:** identical normalized input, policy, model/configuration, namespace and scope within the accepted TTL. It is not a semantic cache. Changed evidence or configuration invalidates the match.
- **Prompt cache:** reuse of a stable provider-side prefix; dynamic evidence and generated output still require inference. A recent observation is not a guaranteed future cache hit.
- **Freshness:** the host must supply updated evidence. The adaptive cache does not enforce monotonic task revisions; replaying an old snapshot can return its old result within TTL. Use the durable task handoff API when a latest-revision check is needed.
- **Limits:** `maxCalls` caps actual POSTs for one adaptive decision. `budgetUsd` is an estimated-cost dispatch threshold, not a provider-enforced prepaid cap. The benchmark additionally reserves estimated cost across the run.
- **Uncertainty:** an interrupted, timed-out, or unaccounted attempt is not automatically retried. Private state and locks preserve the need for host review.

See [adaptive routing](docs/adaptive-routing.md), [task routing and handoffs](docs/task-router.md), and the [Node exports](src/index.mjs). Local state directories can contain task evidence; keep them private even though the software repository is public.

호스트가 업무·현재 근거·실제로 사용할 수 있는 도구 목록을 전달하면, 라우터가 다음 경로를 권고합니다. 동일 입력 결과를 재사용하고, 새 판단은 업무 난도와 최근 비용·캐시 관측에 따라 JEV/Luna/Astra 중에서 선택합니다. 모델은 임의의 도구나 실행 권한을 만들 수 없습니다.

**스킬과 실행 엔진은 별개입니다.** 스킬은 Codex·Claude에게 이 저장소의 명령을 사용하는 절차를 알려 줍니다. Node 실행 엔진과 API 키는 로컬에 따로 준비해야 하며, 스킬 설치만으로 브라우저·봇이 연결되거나 선택된 업무가 자동 실행되지는 않습니다. Claude in Chrome 연결 코드는 있으나 실제 Claude 브라우저 검증은 아직 완료하지 않았습니다.

위 실험에서는 새 업무 12건의 핵심 판단·계산·마감·승인 조건이 모두 맞았고, 인용까지 포함한 엄격 검사는 11/12였습니다. 정확 재생 6건의 추가 호출·비용은 0이었습니다. 적응형이 이번 평균 시간은 가장 짧았지만 비용은 Luna+Astra가 조금 더 낮았습니다. 이 작은 합성 평가를 모든 실제 업무의 정확도·속도·비용 우월성으로 일반화하지 않습니다.

[국문 설치 안내](docs/INSTALL.ko.md)에 키 준비, 오프라인 검사, 유료 실행, Codex·Claude 스킬 설치, 캐시와 오류 처리 방법을 정리했습니다. 공개 결과의 시간은 전체 로컬 업무 흐름을 측정하며, 프롬프트 캐시를 답안 재사용이나 무료 실행과 혼동하지 않습니다.

## Reproduce the paid benchmark

Run offline preflight first. Use a new output path; existing reports are never overwritten. This command sends synthetic evidence to TypeSafe and OpenRouter and can incur charges.

```sh
node --use-system-ca -- benchmarks/complex-mission-eval.mjs --live --env-file .env --output benchmarks/results/my-complex-run/report.json --budget-usd 5 --max-requests 80
```

The published run used 36 requests and approximately $0.69348 in the stated accounting scope. A rerun can differ in latency, output, cache hits, and cost; the configured $5 reservation is not a promise of the bill. The benchmark creates local analysis artifacts only. It does not submit applications, operate a browser, or record a screen video.
